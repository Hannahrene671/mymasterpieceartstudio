		<h1>How does it work?</h1>

		<p>You can select from our Studio Package Options or you can select single items à la carte. You just pay for your package, canvas, paper, clay, etc., and not for the studio time (unless you’re using the pottery wheels). We also have a rotating stock of other interesting, seasonal projects and pre-made bisqueware waiting to be painted by you! Take your time exploring the different art stations, there are many tools and art media for you to use!</p>

		<h1>What if I don’t know how to draw/paint/sculpt?</h1>

		<p>Don’t worry, the Open Studio is the perfect place for art exploration and we have a wonderful staff to give you a tour and help you out with any art questions you might have.</p>

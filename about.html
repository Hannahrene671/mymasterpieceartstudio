			<h2>My Masterpiece Art Studio</h2>
			<p>
				We have been at our <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/My+Masterpiece+Art+Studio/@45.4627177,-122.7919815,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x54950c450bacf2f1:0x183e4932d8ccffd8!8m2!3d45.4627177!4d-122.7897928">brick and mortar location</a> for over 11 years. I have been offering after school and art enrichment experiences for children for more than sixteen years. My passion for art education comes from a diverse background, beginning with parents who were both fine artists and educators…there was always an opportunity and the encouragement to make things! My interest, education and experience span from art history, fine art instructor in many media including drawing, painting, sculpting and printmaking to many years working in design, creating award-winning and nationally published work.</p>

					<p>As my interest and experience grew along with my own family, I became specifically aware of the need for art education in my own children’s schools and began assisting in this process, instructing fine art and developing art curriculum to fill the void. This was not only incredibly rewarding, but simply became a new career choice. The “art studio” idea was conceived to provide creative, affordable art options for children and their families in an entertaining and enriching environment.In 2007, my Masterpiece Art Studio opened. MMAS has since been profiled in the national and local news media, and continues as a small, Mom run business!
					Along with a warm, wonderful and talented staff, we have continued to develop new and successful techniques to use in the studio and school classes. Art speaks to children of all learning styles, providing them the opportunity to think critically and uniquely express ideas. We strive to be mindful and make each art experience a positive and fun experience. We look forward seeing you and your families at the studio whether for the Open Studio, class, workshop or a birthday party! </p>

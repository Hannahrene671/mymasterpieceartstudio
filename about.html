		<quote>"My Masterpiece Art Studio has been in it’s brick and mortar location for over 11 years. I have been offering after school and art enrichment experiences for children for more than sixteen years. My passion for art education comes from a diverse background, beginning with parents who were both fine artists and educators…there was always an opportunity and the encouragement to make things! My interest, education and experience span from art history, fine art instructor in many media including drawing, painting, sculpting and printmaking to many years working in design, creating award-winning and nationally published work."</quote>

		<quote>"As my interest and experience grew along with my own family, I became specifically aware of the need for art education in my own children’s schools and began assisting in this process, instructing fine art and developing art curriculum to fill the void. This was not only incredibly rewarding, but simply became a new career choice. The “art studio” idea was conceived to provide creative, affordable art options for children and their families in an entertaining and enriching environment.
		In 2007, my Masterpiece Art Studio opened. MMAS has since been profiled in the national and local news media, and continues as a small, Mom run business!
		Along with a warm, wonderful and talented staff, we have continued to develop new and successful techniques to use in the studio and school classes. Art speaks to children of all learning styles, providing them the opportunity to think critically and uniquely express ideas. We strive to be mindful and make each art experience a positive and fun experience. We look forward seeing you and your families at the studio whether for the Open Studio, class, workshop or a birthday party! Create, learn, be inspired, do art!" </quote>

				<h1>Teacher Jackson</h1>
				<quote>"I was born and raised in Salem, and like most artists, I’ve been drawing and creating as long as I can remember. The adults who had the most impact during my childhood were those who respected me and fostered my artistic curiosity, and I seek to encourage young artists much in the same way. I received my BA from Hobart College in art history and painting. I’m fascinated by the concept of serendipity in art. Accidents and mistakes and unconscious mark-making. Smudged fingerprints and stray lines. The little tiny flaws that reveal the human touch in a work of art, that say “a real live person made this”. One of my favorite artists is Willem de Kooning, for how he exploited the physical, visceral nature of paint as a raw material. I’m also inspired by Cézanne, who disregarded the rules of traditional perspective and used color to build form and create depth. I incorporate these lessons into my own art, whether I’m drawing with pencil or painting with oil."</quote>

				<h1>Teacher Rachel</h1>
				<quote>"Art has always been who I am and how I define myself. Growing up I took every opportunity to express my creativity, through painting, drawing and dancing. I earned my BFA at Oregon State University where I focused my study in painting and served as captain of OSU Elite Dance team. My work is inspired by the Flora and Fauna of the Pacific Northwest, and the various impacts of cultural standards of beauty upon the human condition. Beauty has a dark side which I find myself drawn to within my art making. I find inspiration in the work of Alphonse Nucha, Lauren Marx and Ashley Judd.  Mycha for his delicate line work and compositions, Marx for her rendering of flora and fauna and Judd for her realism work in oil as well as her exploration of femininity.  I love working in gauche, oil and good old pen and paper which has held a place in my heart from an early age!"</quote>

				<h1>Guest Teacher Nic</h1>
				<quote>"Born and raised in the Seattle area, I’ve alternately made art, played sports and explored nature. After completing my BA in Studio Painting at Vassar College, I’ve come back to the Pacific Northwest to pursue my art career and work with children to help them develop their creativity and self-expression through art. Clay is a favorite medium. I enjoy sharing my pottery throwing expertise with children and adults at the studio as amazing pots and bowls emerge in their hands! Many artists inspire me. Matisse and Basquiat are among my favorites because of their bright color and creative subjects and Donald Glover because his creative expression isn’t limited to one medium. My favorite mediums are oil and spray paints because of their versatility."</quote>

				<h1>Guest Teacher Jenna</h1>
				<quote>"I’ve been creating as long as I can remember, drawing and fashioning items out of recycled materials. I love working in multiple media and figuring out how to make things. An Oregon native, I graduated with a BFA in drawing and painting at Oregon College of Art and Craft. I love objects with history, like antiques and geological formations such as gemstones and fossils.   I have many favorite artists, but my top three would be Alphonse Mucha for his delicate use of line and color, Wayne Thiebaud for his whimsical subject matter, and Audrey Flack for her enormous photo-realistic paintings.  My work is heavily influenced by vibrant use of color, pattern, layers, and texture.  While at OCAC, I majored in drawing and painting but also explored photography and fibers."</quote>

	<h1>FAQs</h1>
			<h3>I see that camps run Monday-Thursday; what about Fridays?</h3>  
				<p>On Fridays we have our Friday Fun Days: a variety of fun open studio activities centered around the theme of the day. We also offer a single day camp from 10:00-2:00 for $58. These creative single day camps include two or more instructed art lessons in clay and paint, including the Friday Fun Art Hour! The Art Hour workshops are from 1:00- 2:00 every week, based on the fun Friday theme. And for the little artist, don’t miss our regular Friday morning Mini Masters class!</p>

			<h3>Can I have my child do a Mixed Media Camp from 10:00am-2:00pm and then do a Clay Camp from 2:00pm-5:00pm?</h3>
				<p>Of course! Just register for both the morning mixed media and the afternoon clay camp!</p>

			<h3>What’s the difference between Wheel Works Camp and Clay Date Camp?</h3>
				<p>Wheel Works is a class all about learning pottery wheel-based techniques and can only accommodate 4 children; the Clay Date focuses on clay hand-building techniques and can accommodate 10 children.</p>

			<h3>If I have to cancel or change camps, what is the refund policy?</h3>
				<p>If you need to change camps we can transfer your child if we know at least a week in advance. If you have to cancel, you must notify us a week in advance and we can give you the full amount in studio credit or if you’d like a refund a 25% administrative fee will be deducted.</p>
